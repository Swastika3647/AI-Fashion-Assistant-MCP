# 🎀 AI Fashion Assistant (MCP Server)

> **As seen on YouTube!** This is the code for my local AI Fashion Stylist that uses computer vision to roast (I mean, critique) your outfits.

## 🧐 What is this?
This is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that runs locally on your machine. Unlike a standard chatbot, this agent has "eyes"—it can read local image files from your computer and analyze them using Google's Gemini Vision models.

**Features:**
* **Computer Vision:** Analyzes cuts, colors, and patterns from local image paths.
* **"Vogue Editor" Persona:** Gives high-fashion, editorial feedback (and sometimes roasts you).
* **Privacy First:** Runs locally; images are processed by the API but not stored on a third-party server.
